## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone and install**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up API keys** (optional):
   - **Spotify**: Replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` in `src/services/spotify.ts`
   - **Listen Notes**: Replace `YOUR_LISTEN_NOTES_API_KEY` in `src/services/listenNotes.ts`

3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîß API Setup

### Spotify API (Recommended)
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app
3. Add your domain to "Redirect URIs" (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
4. Copy the Client ID to `src/services/spotify.ts`

### Listen Notes API (Optional)
1. Sign up at [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/api/)
2. Get your API key
3. Replace `YOUR_LISTEN_NOTES_API_KEY` in `src/services/listenNotes.ts`

**Note**: The app works without API keys using demo data!

## üß† How It Works

### Matching Algorithm
The app uses a sophisticated scoring system:

1. **Mood matching**: Keywords like "happy", "uplifting", "joy" boost episodes for happy moods
2. **Theme matching**: Content-specific keywords (e.g., "mystery", "crime" for thriller)
3. **Duration filtering**: Prefers episodes within your time limit
4. **Recency bonus**: Recently published episodes get extra points

### Keyword Maps
```javascript
const vibeKeywordMap = {
  happy: ['uplifting', 'joy', 'funny', 'positive', 'feel good'],
  sad: ['empathy', 'healing', 'grief', 'storytelling', 'emotions'],
  anxious: ['calm', 'soothing', 'mindfulness', 'meditation', 'relax'],
  // ... more moods
};
```
